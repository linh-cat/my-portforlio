        <p>
          üí° I am a Front-End developer with more than 2+ year of experience. I
          like to explore new technologies and develop software solutions and
          quick hacks. üéì I'm currently studying software engineer at the Sai
          Gon University of HCM. ‚úçÔ∏è In my free time, I love to relax myself by
          listening to music and watching my favorite films. I study all days,
          so after 10 PM is the only time that I can use for myself. I have a
          smartphone, so I can download a lot of songs from the Internet for
          free, and I usually listen to them with my headphones. If noone is at
          home, I will turn on the loudspeakers to have the best experience with
          music, but most of the time I only listen to music with headphones.
          Besides music, movies are my second biggest love. When I am not
          listening to the songs, I turn on my computer and watch some of the
          latest movies on the websites. Since most of the best films are from
          Europe and America, this is also a way for me to improve my English
          skills.
